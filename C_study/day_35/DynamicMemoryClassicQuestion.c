//char * str = NULL; //create pointer variable str value is null
//printf("hello world") Actually pass the address of the first variable in this string
//so can pass a pointer of a string

//The life cycle of local variables is only within the body of this function
//The space allocated by the stack is local, and the space allocated by the heap is global.

//Pointer variables must be initialized with a value, otherwise there may be wild pointer problems.

//The static modified variable changes its memory storage method and increases its life cycle.
